This is a little project to help me stay motivated while studying, hopefully..

The idea of this came to me randomly 2 days before I had to take 3 tests. I had done nothing to study for them and, with my then recent motivation to get back into coding, I thought, why not code a study helper so I'll actually study for the tests? I then continued to procrasinate working on this for the next 2 days. Monday was not a very swell day, I must say.
